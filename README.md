This is a beat tracking system for the Ballroom dataset, inspired by the "Multi-Feature Beat Tracking" paper by Zapata et al. Initially, a deep learning approach using RNNs was explored but was found computationally impractical, leading to a shift towards traditional signal processing. The system employs 10 onset detection functions (ODFs) to extract beat novelty, followed by peak picking and a mutual agreement algorithm to refine the final beat sequence. Downbeats are identified using an inter-onset interval histogram, inspired by Klapuri et al. The system was evaluated using the F1 score, with Jive achieving the highest (0.8928) and Waltz the lowest (0.5003). An alternative approach integrating a Predominant Local Pulse (PLP) framework showed improved performance but was not adopted due to computational cost and reliance on AI-assisted implementation. Future improvements include revisiting RNN-based methods and deeper exploration of tempogram and PLP curve computations
